## Describing Association Results  
I was interested in examining the differences in the positive and negative words associated with "you" for each group - female and male senators. In looking at the results, it does not seem that there are many words that could definitely be considered positive. However, there are many words that can definitely be considered negative. Below is a table showing the negative words most associated with "you" that Twitter users wrote in response to tweets from each group of senators. Words in bold are words that are unique to each list.
