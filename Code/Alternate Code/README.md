## Description

The code here is alternate code which has a different file structure for loading and saving files, in case this works better for others. In the regular code folder, the files are loaded using the command (for example):

read.csv("myfile.csv")

In this **alternate** code, the files are loaded with the below command: 

read.csv("Data/myfile.csv")
